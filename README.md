# Company Election

Small web app (frontend + backend) for a company election system built as a learning project.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saad9098-j/company-election.git
   cd company-election
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install the Live Server extension (by Ritwick Dey).

4. Right-click index.html and choose “Open with Live Server.”

That’s all — the app will open in your browser at something like
http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

Note: Opening the file directly (file://.../index.html) won’t work properly, because Vue and Vue Router require a local server for routing and scripts to load correctly.
